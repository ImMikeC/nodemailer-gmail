## What is clientId?
The client ID is a unique identifier for your application that is issued by Google when you set up OAuth 2.0 authentication. It is used to identify your application when you request access to a user's Google Account.

To get your client ID and client secret, you'll need to create a project in the Google Cloud Console and enable the Gmail API. You can then create a "Client ID" for your project by following these steps:

    1. Go to the Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
    2. Click the project drop-down and select or create the project that you want to use for your application.
    3. Click the hamburger menu and select APIs & Services > Credentials.
    4. On the Credentials page, click the Create credentials drop-down and select OAuth client ID.
    5. Select the application type "Web application" and click the Create button.
    6. In the modal that appears, provide a name for your client ID and add the URLs for your application's authorization callback and JavaScript origins.
    7. Click the Create button to create the client ID.

You'll be able to find your client ID and client secret in the Cloud Console under the "Credentials" page. Make sure to keep these values secret, as they allow your application to access the Gmail API on behalf of your users.
